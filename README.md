# Custom ProgressView Using iPhone 14 Pro Dynamic Island

## Overview

This project showcases a custom ProgressView developed using SwiftUI, focusing on integrating Apple's new iPhone 14 Pro Dynamic Island feature. The dynamic island ensures a consistent and optimized user experience, adapting the UI to the device's form factor and orientation.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Island Integration**: The ProgressView is designed to seamlessly adapt to the iPhone 14 Pro's dynamic island, providing a smooth and intuitive experience.
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid animations and transitions keep users engaged as they monitor download progress.

## Code Highlights

The project leverages SwiftUI and encapsulates the custom ProgressView in a modular and maintainable structure. Key components of the code include:

- `Home.swift`: This file demonstrates how the ProgressView is integrated into the UI and triggered by a button press. It also manages the download progress and UI elements' interactions.
- `DynamicProgress`: A class responsible for managing the state and logic of the dynamic progress view. It handles adding, updating, and removing the view dynamically.
- `DynamicProgressView`: A SwiftUI view struct that encapsulates the actual progress view, complete with animations and real-time updates.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/swaminathan103/Dynamic-Island-Custom-ProgressView.git`
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the project on the iPhone 14 Pro simulator.
4. Tap the "Download" button to see the custom ProgressView in action.
